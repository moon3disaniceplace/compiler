# done with lex parser and semantic (should fix some bugs)
firstly, use make command for compiling the copiler files
you can run it as you run every file with input/output

in the main file, there is printvisitor and semanticvisitor
printvisitor is designed to print the ast
printsemantic is designed to print the scopes

if you enter input file that isnt allowed it will tell you where the error is (for semantic errors you must run printsemantic)

# designed for linux interface but i think should work in windows as well
